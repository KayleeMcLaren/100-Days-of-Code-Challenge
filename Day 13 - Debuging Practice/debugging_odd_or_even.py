# Debug Odd or Even:

number = int(input("Which number do you want to check?"))

if number % 2 = 0:
    print("This is an even number.")
else:
    print("This is an odd number.")


# Solution:

number = int(input("Which number do you want to check?"))

if number % 2 == 0: # one equals sign is assignment, while two equals signs check for equality
    print("This is an even number.")
else:
    print("This is an odd number.")
